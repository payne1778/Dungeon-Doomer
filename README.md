# Dungeon-Doomer

Welcome to Dungeon Doomer!

The game is simple. You are placed in a dungeon and have two main objectives:

    1. Acquire as much gold as possible
    2. Escape with as much health as possible

However, the game will not make this easy for you. 

    - Every turn you take, you will receive a two point health deduction.
    - Various monsters throughout the dungeon can take a lot of health away in combat.

To help out with this, remember:

    - Potions are your friend! You can buy them from merchants found throughout the dungeon.
    - You may find random gold in different rooms throughout the dungeon. Consider exploring!
    - Enter "help" for tips and assistance. Words with asterisks are commands you can use!
    - You and monsters may be able to retreat from battle. 

For an added challenge, turn off the retreat feature in the Settings menu.

Best of luck, hero!
